# Network Security Project for Phishing Data

## Introduction
This project focuses on network security, specifically targeting phishing data. The goal is to analyze, detect, and prevent phishing attacks using various security measures and techniques.

## Objectives
- Analyze phishing data to identify common patterns and techniques used by attackers.
- Develop methods to detect phishing attempts in real-time.
- Implement security measures to prevent phishing attacks.
- Evaluate the effectiveness of the implemented security measures.

## Project Structure
- **Data Collection**: Gather phishing data from various sources.
- **Data Analysis**: Analyze the collected data to identify patterns and techniques.
- **Detection Methods**: Develop and implement methods to detect phishing attempts.
- **Prevention Measures**: Implement security measures to prevent phishing attacks.
- **Evaluation**: Assess the effectiveness of the detection and prevention methods.

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Network_Security
    ```
3. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
    ```
4. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
     
## Conclusion
This project aims to enhance network security by focusing on phishing data. By analyzing, detecting, and preventing phishing attacks, we can improve the overall security of networks and protect users from malicious activities.
